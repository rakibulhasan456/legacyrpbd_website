I don’t care what happened before but from today whoever isn’t following this will be not able to Do RP in our server. We don’t want any more PVP without RP build up/Backstory/ Rp gains behind it<br><br>1️⃣ <strong>Escalate Before Violence</strong><br>No shooting/Hunting Gang members over small things. All violence needs proper RP buildup. Otherwise it will be called as RDM.<br><br>2️⃣ <strong>Gang Meetings Required</strong><br>From now on any kinds of issues with Gangs You can’t just go and attack You must need a gang meeting first. Yes sometime some gang shit might happen to you but that doesn’t mean you will just tweet or taunt players to statt fighting/Hunting..<br><br>Setup a meeting in a Club/Bar/Restaurant not in HQ!!! Then discuss whats going on or whats gonna happen next&nbsp;<br>That meeting place will be automatically Green Zone that means no fighting even after meeting ends.<br><br>3️⃣ <strong>Give Warning= Give time</strong><br>If you give warning to any gang you have to give time minimum 10min to stack up. If you give someone Hq Attack Warning give minimum 15 min.<br><br>That also means you can’t just camp in-front of hq or Fighting location just to take advantage.<br><br>When You fought with the same gang already 2 times even after meeting but still didn’t fix your issue, You must Call Group Manager for a meeting to Initiate Gang War. However fighting over a small thing and taking the issue into Gang War will not be tolerated.<br><br>4️⃣ <strong>Chain of Command</strong><br>Only leaders or Co-Leader can Call out other Gang for meeting and Discuss.No personal or members meeting.<br><br>5️⃣ <strong>XP Remove</strong><br>Random Fights over silly reason/Hunting, Taunting will lead you -300xp and Multiple time same fault will lead you to 1 Gang Strike.<br><br>6️⃣ <strong>Be Creative</strong><br>Gang RP isn’t just shooting. Try dealing not only to other Gangs but also to Civilians, From now on we will also monitor which Gangs are contributing to the City to help Civilians. Hire middle man to distribute things etc.<br><br>Remember we are not telling you to stop fighting but we are telling you to go though a proper RP build for instance in Real life gangs just don’t go for hunt to shoot down other gang over a rough talk.
